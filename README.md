## Preface

This post is summarizing the data structure and algorithm fundamentals you might need in a coding interview and the corresponding implementations in different languages (Currently Python, Java, and C++). 

You may or may not know some of them. It's totally fine. You could easily find videos, blogs, and source code about these data structures and algorithms online.

I tried to make it accurate and correct. But I might be still missing something important or writing something wrong. If you find any mistake or have good advice, you are welcome to contact me. If you find it useful, welcome to star, fork, and share this repo. Please also provide the reference if you are going to refer to this repo.

Coding classic algorithms may not represent your actual ability and specialization. Don't feel discouraged if you cannot solve it in limited time or fail an interview. It takes some time!

I will keep updating this doc and make it more helpful. I hope everyone could land a dream job eventually. Keep coding!

> - Cheatsheet(ALGS4)(Java): [Algorithms and Data Structures Cheatsheet](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/cheatsheet/)  
> - [Big-O Algorithm Complexity](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)  


> Python: [Data Structures — Python 3.8.6 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#), [Common Python Data Structures (Guide) – Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-data-structures/)  
> Java: [Lesson: Interfaces (The Java™ Tutorials > Collections)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html)  
> C++: [Containers - C++ Reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/)  

### Basic
* **Array**: 

> Python: list  
> Java: ArrayList  
> C++: std::vector  

* **LinkedList**: 

> Python: list or customized  
> Java: LinkedList   
> C++: std::list

* **HashTable**: 

> Python: dict(), collections.defaultdict()   
> Java: HashMap  
> C++: std::unordered_map  

* **HashSet**

> Python: set()  
> Java: HashSet()  
> C++: std::unordered_set  

### Advanced
* **Tree**
* **Graph**
* **Stack**

> Python: list, deque  
> Java: Stack  
> C++: std::stack

* **Deque**

> Python: collections.deque()  
> Java: LinkedList, ArrayDeque  
> C++: std::deque 

* **PriorityQueue** (heap)

> Python: heapq, collections.PriorityQueue (thread safe)  
> Java: PriorityQueue  
> C++: std::priority_queue

* BinarySearchTree (map)

> Python: None (try to use [bisect](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html), but big O is different)  
> Java: TreeMap  
> C++: std::map

* BinarySearchTree (set)

> Python: None (try to use [bisect](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html)], but big O is different)  
> Java: TreeSet  
> C++: std::set

* Trie: a map of key, map pairs; 

> - `T = lambda: collections.defaultdict(T)`
> - [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)

* UnionFind
> You can implement by yourself in an interview, here is a very concise and brilliant template (path compression has been included):
> ```py
> uf = {i:i for i in range(len(M))}
> def find(p):
>   if uf[p] != p:
>       uf[p] = find(uf[p])
>   return uf[p]
>
> def union(p1, p2):
>   a1, a2 = find(p1), find(p2)
>   uf[a2] = a1
> ```
> WARNING: this implementation has some limitation, such as you need to traverse the `uf` by calling `find` for every element with a `set` to count the number of unions, this operation is O(n) since the length of the path for every element will be no more than 2.
> 
>Time complexity for union find is a little bit tricky, the union and find operation will take log*n time. Please check this [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) to get a better understanding.

#### Algorithms
- @[Tushar Roy - Coding Made Simple](https://www.youtube.com/user/tusharroy2525/featured)
	- [Graph Algorithms @ Tushar Roy - Coding Made Simple](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrmLmBdmIlpu2f2g8ltqaaCZiq6GJvl1j): I found these videos very useful to understand and implement graph algorithms. Tushar also provide the source code.

### Takeaway

#### Before the interview
- Practice on some platforms such as LeetCode, Google KickStart, HackerRank;
	- LeetCode Premium is very useful, especially you can filter questions with tags and companies, and sort problems by frequency.
	- Participating in the weekly contest on LeetCode is also a good way to practice interivew.
- Find someone to do mock interview.

#### In the interview
- Correctness matters, find a workable solutions at least.
- Time matters, spending too much on a simple solution you have known is not a good option.
- Communication matters, think loud and let the interviewer know what you are thinking about. Then the interviewer can know how to give you hints.
- Handle edge cases, you can skip some parts handling edge cases and complete them later, but you must let the interviewer know that you have noticed these edge cases. You can add some TODOs or move it to a function to implement later.
- Time complexity and space complexity are necessary. Even the interviewer forgets to ask you about the complexity analysis, you should address them. Because it is an important part of the feedback the interviewer will submit.
